# POA Historical Weather Data Comparation
A comparation along 20 years of weather forecasting data from Porto Alegre. Using the pandas python library, jupyter notebook and seaborn.

## How to get the data
I got this .csv file with historical data from Porto Alegre from the INMET (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia) website. It's very simple to get the data in the way want (specific variables, date range, etc). You can go to https://bdmep.inmet.gov.br/ (the INMET database website) and ask for it, it gives you many options to customise your data.
